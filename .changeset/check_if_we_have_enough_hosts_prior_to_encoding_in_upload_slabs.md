# Check if we have enough hosts prior to encoding in upload_slabs

#261 by @Alrighttt

Fixes https://github.com/SiaFoundation/sia-sdk-rs/issues/251

- Added an `available_for_upload` method that returns the amount of known hosts marked `good_for_upload`.
- Added a check in `upload_slabs` that verifies we have enough good hosts prior to encoding any data. 
- Adds a variant to `QueueError` for `upload_slabs`'s new failure case. This enables testing for this new case specifically.
